# School_District_Analysis

## Project Overview
Maria is the chief data scientist for a city school district. She has requested an analysis of school spending and standardized test scores. 
Throughout this project i helped the school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.
Overall, the goal was to find obvious trends in the school performances.
 
 ## Challenge Overview
Some of the students were caught with academic dishonesty from Thomas High School. 
The school district discovered that the standardized test scores for ninth grade students at Thomas High School were incorrect, and they requested 
for updated data summaries. It was best to only replace the ninth grade math and reading scores at Thomas High School 
while keeping all other data associated with this student group.

## Resources
- Data Source: schools_complete.csv, students_complete.csv
- Software: Python 3.9, Anaconda Navigator 4.10, Jupyter Notebook 6.1.3

## Challenge Results

[Github Issues](https://github.com/Laeh03/School_District_Analysis/issues/1#issue-957580775)

When looking over the average scores and passing percentages among the 15 high schools in the school district, the average math score dropped .1, 
the average reading score stayed the same, the percentage passing math dropped 1%, the percentage passing reading dropped 1%, and the overall passing percent dropped 1%.
The only change in data is with Thomas High School. The overall math and reading passing numbers decreased.




  
Thomas High School moved from 2nd place overall with a passing % of ~92% down to last place with a passing % of ~68%.

âœ“ How does removing the ninth grade scores affect the following?  

- Math and Reading Scores by Grade  
Thomas High School's 9th grade class has no math or reading score data to count. Everything else was unaffected.

- Scores by School Spending  
The $630-644 bin saw a decrease in the passing percentages since Thomas High School was in that spending range. Though, interestingly   the average math and reading scores for that range remained the same.

- Scores by School Size  
The Medium (1000-2000) bin saw a decrease in the passing percentages since Thomas High School was in that school size. Though, interestingly the average math and reading scores for that range remained the same.
  
- Scores by School Type  
The Charter schools saw a decrease in the passing percentages since Thomas High School was in that school type. Though, interestingly the average math and reading scores for that range remained the same.
