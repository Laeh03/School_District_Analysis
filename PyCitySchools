# School_District_Analysis

## Project Overview
Maria is the chief data scientist for a city school district. She has requested an analysis of school spending and standardized test scores. 
Throughout this project i helped the school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.
Overall, the goal was to find obvious trends in the school performances.
 
 ## Challenge Overview
 Some of the students were caught with academic dishonesty from Thomas High School. 
The school district discovered that the standardized test scores for ninth grade students at Thomas High School were incorrect, and they requested 
for updated data summaries. 
After further discussion, it was best to only replace the ninth grade math and reading scores at Thomas High School 
while keeping all other data associated with this student group intact

## Resources
- Data Source: schools_complete.csv, students_complete.csv
- Software: Python 3.9, Anaconda Navigator 4.10, Jupyter Notebook 6.1.3

## Challenge Summary

✓ How is the district summary affected?  
The average math score decreased by 0.1 points while the average reading score stayed the same.  The percentage of students passing math decreased by 1% as did the percentage of students passing reading. The overall passing percentage also decreased by 1%.

✓ How is the school summary affected?  
The only change in data is with Thomas High School. The overall math and reading passing numbers decreased.

✓ How does removing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance, relative to the other schools?  
Thomas High School moved from 2nd place overall with a passing % of ~92% down to last place with a passing % of ~68%.

✓ How does removing the ninth grade scores affect the following?
